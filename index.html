      My name is Johnie Rodgers III (Tre is my nickname).

      I was born and raised in Dallas, specifically The Colony.

      I graduated from The Colony High School in 2019
      and attend Southern Methodist University.

      I am currently study to attain a B.B.A in Finance, B.S. in Psychology,
      and minor in Statistics. Even though I am not majoring in Computer
      Science, I try to learn much of what is taught in the classroom as well
      as what is not.

      I first took an interest in programming the summer after I graduated high
      school and really got into it a few months later, starting with Swift.

      After about a month, I took an extended break from Swift and took to
      learning Python, C/C++, and Go.

      In addition to these, my endless curiosity has led me to dabble in
      other languages like Flutter, Rust, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java,
      and more.

      Ultimately, my goal is to combine my studies at university
      with computer science in order to create something magnificent,
      whether it be an app, fintech company, or the likes.
